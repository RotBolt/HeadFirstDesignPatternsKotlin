1.If design patterns are so great, why can't someone build a library of them so I don't have to?
  A. Design patterns ate higher level than libraries. They tell us on how to structure our classes to
  solve a certain problem. It is our job to adapt those designs to fit our particular application.

2. Aren't libraries and frameworks also design patterns?
   A. They arr not design patterns. They provide specific implementations that we link into our code.
