1. Strategy Pattern
   The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
   Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.
   For example: In Duck Simulator example, `FlyBehavior` and `QuackBehavior` represents family of algorithms.
   and these behaviors or algorithms can vary independently of clients. At the same time clients can use them
   interchangeably.

 2. Observer Pattern
    The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
    all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
